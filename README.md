# Machine Learning with Go - AMLD 2018

This repo includes all of the materials that you will need for the "Machine Learning with Go" workshop at [Applied ML Days 2018](https://www.appliedmldays.org/conf2018/workshop_sessions/machine-learning-with-go.1).  This workshop will help attendees understand how Go can help them be productive and innovative in machine learning, and we will learn how to leverage Go to build robust and valuable applications. To this end, the workshop will clearly introduce the technical aspects of building predictive models in Go, but it will also help attendees understand how and why Go-based machine learning workflows are being applied in real-world scenarios.

## Agenda

1. [Introduction to Go](introduction_to_go)
2. [Data Gathering and Organization](data_gathering_organization)
3. [Building ML Models in Go](building_models)
4. [Deployment and Scaling](deploy_scale)
5. [Bonus](bonus)

## Prerequisites

- Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and try the [Go tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
- Connect to the Wifi
- (optional) Set up your [IDE for Go](https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining#editors) (`gofmt`, `golint`, etc.)
- (optional) Join [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/) and find the `#data-science` channel
